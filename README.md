# Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) using Arduino

This project implements a basic Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) using an Arduino. The system allows users to vote for candidates by pressing buttons, and displays real-time results on an LCD screen. It's a simple, cost-effective model to demonstrate the concept of electronic voting.

## Features:
- Button-based voting system.
- LCD display for showing instructions and vote counts.
- Real-time tracking and displaying of results.
- Easy to set up and use.

## Components Used:
- Arduino Uno
- 16x2 LCD Display
- Push Buttons (for voting)
- LEDs (for status indication)
- Jumper Wires
- Breadboard
- resistors
- potentiometer

## How It Works:
1. Users vote by pressing a button corresponding to a candidate.
2. Each button press is counted and displayed on the LCD.
3. The system shows the results after voting is completed.
4. 
## Setup Instructions:
1. Connect the components according to the circuit diagram.
2. Upload the Arduino code to your Arduino board.
3. Power the system on and start voting.

## Code:
The Arduino code is written in C++ and can be found in the `EVM.ino` file.
